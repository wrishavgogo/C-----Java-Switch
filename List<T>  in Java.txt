In this List in java there are specific ways to access and handle it which are different from normal Array 

*** To get Length of the List 

 List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>(); 
 nums.size() -> .size() function has to be used 

*** To get element at index i 

 nums.get(i) -> .get() method has to be used
