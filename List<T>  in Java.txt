In this List in java there are specific ways to access and handle it which are different from normal Array 

*** To get Length of the List 

 List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>(); 
 nums.size() -> .size() function has to be used 

Very Important : 

List do not have .length property , 
Only Arrays have it , 
and String and List have .length() and .size() respectively 

*** To get element at index i 

 nums.get(i) -> .get() method has to be used 

*** Why Functions are there in List and not in normal Array ? 

ArrayList internally is implemented by LinkedList , and hence for Data Hiding and encapsulation Data is required to be hidden and functions have been made 


*** to add an element at any position to change the size of the list ****


list.add(index, element);
list.add(1 , 4) -> adds 4 b/w 0  and 1 -> it will add in such a way , that 4 gets placed at index 1
list.add(0 , 5) -> adds 5 in the front of the list 

Original List: [1, 2, 3]
List after adding 4 at index 1: [1, 4, 2, 3]
List after adding 5 at index 0: [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]


*************************************************** ways to reverse an arrayList *******************************************

List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
ans.add(1);
ans.add(2);
ans.add(3);
ans.add(4);

Collections.reverse(ans);   <------ this is used to reverse an arrayList
