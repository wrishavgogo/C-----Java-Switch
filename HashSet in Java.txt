HashSet is like unordered Set in java , 

HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();  

here insert function is not there 

here we have 
set.add(i); 
set.contains(i); 



Iterator : to traverse the elements of the Set 

Set<Integer> st = new HashSet<>();
Iterator it = st.iterator().next();




When Iterator is created its not pointing at any element , when we call the .next() method it starts pointing to the next element . 

Set<String> st = new HashSet<>();
st.add("A");
st.add("B");
st.add("C");

Iterator<String> it = st.iterator(); // Iterator is created
At this moment, the iterator is not pointing to any element. You need to call next() to move it to the first element.
