So we have various ways in which we can traverse the whole DataStructure . 

Like 

Set<Integer> st = new HashSet<>();
st.add(1);

Iterator it = st.iterator();  ---> now this is a raw type iterator . 

then why returning you have to manually typeCast it 

(int)it.next(); 


*** Remember when you just do st.iterator() , the iterator is not pointing anywhere , you have to call the .next() method to get it point to the first element 

Instead you can do something like 

Iterator<Integer> it = st.iterator();
return it.next() ;
